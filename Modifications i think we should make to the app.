Because of time, i thought we could remove the whole authentication thing for general users. the aunthentication for doctors and admin could
just be a permanent password done with an if statement. i also removed the admin class because the admin isnt necessarily entering any information, 
just overseeing what has been entered. The tables are for availability, doctor, user (which could be admin or patient) and appointment.

I was thinking that on opening of the app, there should be a home page shwoing a welcome messgae, and asking the person to input their role, whether patient, doctor,
or admin. and then a button to sumbit that. on clicking patient, it would take them to a page where they enter their details and book based on
the availability of doctors available. On clicking doctor, they arre directed to a page where they'd have to confirm that with the permanent password,
when confirmed, theywill be directed to another page where they enteer details and availability.
